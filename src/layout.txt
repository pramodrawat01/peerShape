Nested routes in React Router must use relative paths (no leading /).
Absolute paths (startring with /) always begin from the root (/).
<Link to> can take either an absolute path (/dashboard/courses/c001) or a relative path (courses/c001).
Use relative paths inside nested components for cleaner routing.
Use absolute paths when linking from outside the parent route.
